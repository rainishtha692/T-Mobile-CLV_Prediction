"Just cancelled service with T-Mobile last month. They raised the final bill $150, I spent 3-4 hours speaking with customer service and still ended up with a non-answer. I finally just paid them offto be rid of them.When we signed up in their store, the employee added a 6th line to my 5 member family, and when I got that removed they took a bunch of our deals with it. Don't believe a word they say in the store. I sure hope that employee's commission was worth the hundreds of dollars they screwed me out of.See more"
"Stood at T-Mobile in Panama City Beach for 45 min without being waited on.  Contacted them online, letting them know AT&T had a $50.00 monthly unlimited plan and Consumer Cellular had a $25.00 monthlyunlimited plan with 5mg data (which is not enough but even with unlimited data it would be under $50.00  When advised of this the operator (Ivy) took over five minutes to respond back.  .  Guess they don't need the business.See more"
I went in to t-mobile Alameda and Wadsworth and I had the best customer experience ever. Mary helped me transfer from Verizon to t-mobile. I got into a 16 pro phone with a cool watch phone and payingless then I did with my old service and she did all the transfers easy and I’m so happy with all my devices. Love T-Mobile and there customer service knocks it out of the park ❤️See more
"As soon as T-Mobile gets your money, customer service becomes non-existent. Most of their support is outsourced to Asia, and all you get is double-talk with no real solutions. It's frustrating, repetitive, and leads nowhere. The moment you need real help, you're left on your own.T-Mobile might lure you in with competitive pricing, but don't be fooled — you get exactly what you pay for. If something goes wrong, be prepared for a long, exhausting ride with zero accountability.See more"

T-Mobile service is so inconsistent. Expensive carrier service with bad service. Customer service doesn’t meet expectations with there continuous outages. Considering in switching carriers. Any recommendations?

"I stayed with T-Mobile for years because the service was decent and the prices were fair. But the way they treated me when I left was disappointing. After switching providers, I received a $230 final bill — no detailed breakdown, no goodwill gesture, no attempt to keep the relationship respectful.Their slogan reads: “Get Even More Without Paying More.” Unfortunately, my experience says otherwise. You will pay more, especially on the way out.T-Mobile, you had a customer who might’ve returned. Now you’ve got a review. If someone from your marketing or retention team still values loyalty, I’m open to a real conversation."

"Tmobile is fraudulent. It does not deserve a 1 star rating. I joined them because I was told I would pay $80 for my business lines. I never knew they lied to me just to sell to me. They sent me a bill of $180 in a month, then I decided to port my lines to a different carrier in February. I was told I needed to pay an outstanding bill of $122.89 before I can port my numbers, I paid and in April I got another bill for $134.66. I asked to know why, they told me because I never completed the porting of my lines which was weird because non of my lines was with them. I paid the $134.66 regardless. Then in May, I received another bill of $7.77, wondering what this is for. Run away from them. I will also be seeking legal action against this fraudulent act."

"on 05-16-25 aprox 5:30 . went to tmobile on rt 44 in new smyrna beach florida. 3 people working there. one was diligently working, other two, Not so much. tall male told me 2 people ahead of me. No problem. waited 10 minutes (mind you only 2 customers in store)  and tall male hols up 1 finger (as in 1 minute) and disappears for 45 minute. Female (red hair) at desk does similar tells me ""one minute"" and vanishes. other employee still working customers and other 2 gone into back room, seen sitting just hanging out laughing. all i wanted to do was either turn in or contact owner of cell phone I found on road. still working, but i couldnt open due to password. finally last customer walks out and i rush to last employee, he said he was off at 5:00 and was seemingly decent guy. 10 minutes later tall male comes out of back, states ""nothing he can do theres no way to find out whos phone it is. I told him he could check the sim card. (hopefully he already knew that...) but didnt want to help or work. he pulls out the sim, then says there wasnt one there, and its NOT a tmobile phone. I ended up waiting for almost an hour to have 2/3 inept, lousy employees jerk me around thinking it funny. I have been with tmo for 10+ years, but am currently shopping for another carrier that has normal employees, NOT lazy, sarcastic, deadbeats ""working"" there that spend more time trying to avoid work than actually DOING any work. so phone cannot be returned as tmobile on rt44 in New Smyrna took the sim card out and palmed it. I tried to get it back to owner wasted time  and got insulted by tmo on rt 44 NSB. If ity were my store I would fire both of them instead of them blowing customers off. I took a couple pix and videos of me being only person in front of store for 5 minutes. will try to post if able."

"Since my husband passed in November I have struggled.  He paid all the bills so to remember and also keep track of month/day is not so easy.  And yes, I thought I had till Saturday but wow it was probably five Saturdays ago! And yes I had my phones turned off.  But the young man in the Festus office and the young woman on the phone, who both were just awesome, got me to the third person, another young man, who helped me get things taken care of so I could move forward again.  My problem, my fault but they were very kind and helped me fix it.  I can not thank each one of them enough.  The company must be good and have a moral code if they have people like those three working there.  Thank you."

"This is stuff people don't usually review. I have a Galaxy A15 5G. It came with 150 pre loaded apps, most of which have nothing to do with the functionality of the phone. There are some, Galaxy Store, for instance, that you CANNOT uninstall or turn off notifications for. Disabling is pointless. It comes up by itself, so it doesn't go into deep sleep. Samsung is very obnoxious about this. It is in two places on my home screen. Another thing: If you block a number, You will still get voicemail, because the phone doesn't ring. No way for them to fix it. That's just the way of it. Unless the last person I spoke to about it is right, in which case, he told me to download T-life. I did. It's an app of ads. I'm looking for another carrier. One that isn't a control freak about MY phone and the service *I* am paying for. I'll have to just get rid of the voicemail until I find another carrier that isn't a control freak."

"Good coverage in cities, but rural areas still have dead zones. Customer service is friendly, though wait times can be long."

"My loyalty, demonstrated by consistent service for over two decades has been met with frustrating and unacceptable customer service.My primary concern involves my 77-year-old father's broken, paid-off phone, which is still under warranty. His DL expired  (by one month only). The required procedures to address the issue were excessively burdensome and unreasonable. The demanded to add an “authorized user” with no connection to my account solely to initiate service was particularly risky and burdensome. Further compounding the problem was the refusal to transfer the SIM card and media from the damaged phone to its replacement, without taking the old phone indefinitely. This lack of proactive troubleshooting and the insistence on unnecessary steps demonstrate a concerning lack of customer empathy, along with the willingness to compromise an ACCOUNT HOLDER OF 23 yrs!Beyond this specific incident, my numerous interactions with T-Mobile representatives have been characterized by repetitive scripted responses, an overwhelming emphasis on upselling, and an overall disregard for the time and inconvenience imposed upon loyal, long-term customer.In order to get my elderly father assistance in another state I was forced to add another “authorized user.”Their priority is revenue generation over customer satisfaction. Every department should not be attempting to upsell! The adherence to policy over practical problem-solving, along with their resistance to address legitimate issues efficiently, are beyond frustrating. I intend to discontinue my service with T-Mobile and purchase my phones outright from another provider to avoid any future issues. When is the FCC going to do something about all of these complaints, or are 6000 people lying. Wells Fargo was held accountable for similar allegations why is T-Mobile exempt of accountability????"

"T-Mobile has failed me as a customer and a fraud victim. Over $4,000 has been stolen from me due to negligence at Store #9523 in Houston, TX. A rep falsely marked my iPhone 14 Pro as returned, giving my ex unauthorized access to my account. I’ve reported this over 100 times—via calls, certified letters, FCC, FTC, BBB, and my bank—but T-Mobile has done nothing. I’ve been ignored, gaslit, and billed for devices I didn’t authorize. No real fraud department, no accountability, no resolution."

I just can't rap my head around I tried explaining that my payment went to Metro instead of T-Mobile but this is my problem I signed up with T-Mobile about 3 months ago and to surprise my payments were going to Metro but why wouldn't T-Mobile reach out to see why I'm not paying but I was they let my internet get 3 months behind and cut me off and I accept if no payment please disconnect my service but I'm one who pays her bills I like living comfortable I don't play games single African American women that's responsible and pay my bills but my internet is off with no answer about getting payment back from Metro I just thought T-Mobile was a little more understanding then that.

"Never purchase a phone from Metro PCS now known as T-Mobile... What they didn't tell me is that the phone is locked for 365 days of service. Although you pay month to month and your phone is paid in full, you can't use your paid phone as you please to go else where like a company with better customer service and prices. I've been with Metro PCS aka T-Mobile for 22 years. I bought a new phone on my birthday because I had a cracked screen and the phone was outdated, then 30 days later I've found a company with better customer service and prices only to find out that I'm locked in Metro T Mobile because of the new phone purchase although I've been with Metro PCS for 22 years. The staff at the  Store clerks were also very childish and unprofessional. Long story short, DON'T BUY A PHONE from Metro because of hidden terms and conditions. They won't tell you about the phone is locked for 365 days for Metro PCS/ T Mobile service only. If they were honest and upfront with this information I would not complain after the purchase. WOW... 86 percent of 1 Star complaints is very telling!"

"My phone is not working wont charge. I tried going online to see about getting a new phone, but I cannot because they send you a text to verify your identity, but phone is not working. I call on the phone and they ask me for a 6-digit pin that I made 6 years ago and i do not remember it. Because I do not remember this pin from 6 years ago, they cannot help me over the phone. I work full time go to school full time and I'm a full-time mom so if you are a busy person T-Mobile is not the place for your business because they will not help you over the phone, they will require you to go to a store hour away. After being a customer for 25 years before it was even called t mobile, I will be canceling my plan. I will also be sure to let ever single person I know how horrible the customer service is at T-Mobile. I will spread it far and wide. TMOLIBE SUCKS"

"Hands down worst cell company in history. They suck at everything. Customer service sucks, cellphones suck, the service is the worst! Atnt is a close 2nd but tmobile has em beat. Tmobile is the worst. Dint take my word, google it,says tmobile is the worst company in this country at everything. I made mistake of switching to these morons and I should have known when something is too good to be true...they gave us free cellphones and only required 1 cell to trade in. I should have known it's because service sucks, calls drop daily, you can never get connected when at home or driving anywhere. I called to complain but they only hire morons too, that never do a thing to help you. I started taking screen shot everytime I saw issue like text not going through or connection lost or internet down but after 11 months I have 100 pics, that's how often there is a problem, it's everyday! I am definitely leaving tmobile as soon as I can. I post everywhere warning others to stay away from this incompetent cell carrier. Worst in the business! In fact they don't get 1 thing right. I woukd post it if they did,but I have nothing positive to say. They even offer free junk when I call to complain and still im saying stay away. How bad must they suck for someone to advise stay away even when free."

"-I tried switching to T-Mobile in 09/2024-they approved me and collected $445.29 in tax and down payment for 3x iPhones and one internet device on a brand new 5 line, one internet account and ship me all the devices to my mothers house since she is retired and always home-the day after I receive the equipment in hand, they cancel my account due to fraud (I believe this is because my billing address and shipping address for the equipment were different)-after 2 months of trying to verify that I am not doing any fraud, I give up and return via return label provided by t mobile. All the equipment was factory sealed still. I never opened anything.-in December 2024 I received a confirmation email that they received the equipment and I should be receiving a refund soon-today is May 12, 2025 and I still have not received my refund for the taxes and downpayment til this day. on May 8th 2025 I chatted with a T-Mobile business rep thru Facebook messenger, again confirmed they received all my equipment (I sent them all the IMEIs that I received and the return of the exact IMEIs was confirmed) but still refuse to refund me in any way. Even to refund the same credit card that was used to purchase the equipment with to begin withThey are basically the ones committing the fraud here. They are scamming me and stole my $445.29. I did not commit any fraud in anyway whatsoever. I created an account using a business that I am the 100% owner of and returned the equipment after they deemed my documents not sufficient enough to verify. Someone tell me what fraud I committed please? I am the victim of fraud here by a huge company called T-Mobile who collected $445.29 in taxes and downpayment and kept it after I returned my equipment. Please help me get my money back from this fraudulent company. They are thieves and scammers. Any human with a brain cell can look at this situation and see they stole my money. They should be in jail"

"I have been with T-Mobile for 10 years. Cellphone service for the most part has been good. Customer  service on the other hand is terrible. None of the staff working at an actual store know what they are doing and do not take accountability for anything. They just tell you to call Customer service as they can't fix any account issues at the store. So, then a person is stuck either calling or texting Customer service and wasting half the day so that in the end, absolutely nothing gets resolved because none of them know WTF they are doing.Recently, my husband and I went to our local store simply to buy him a new phone. The male associate told us how we were currently paying too much for our plan and that we should switch to this different plan and there was a promotion going on  so that my husband would get his phone for half price and we would get an IPad and a Samsung tablet for free. Yes, he said BOTH. All we had to do was pay the taxes. We get home and discover the p360 insurance we had on 2 of our phones never got put back onto the plan and no insurance was put on the new phone, Ipad, or Tablet. This could've been a real problem if something would've happened to one of our devices. So, I went in my account and opened a chat with a ""specialist"" to get the insurance put on. What a sh*t show that was. Turns out that 2 hours later, the insurance was put on,  but was being charged the wrong price. Then, I get my monthly bill. For years, my bill was always $280 a month. This new plan, the was supposed to save me money, has now produced my monthly bill to be $410. I took the printouts of all my bills to my local T-Mobile store to hopefully get answers and the issue  resolved. The associate informed me that I hadn't gotten credits for any of the promotions and that I was being too much for the insurance. Then, he ----- the same associate who talked us into this plan and said BOTH the IPad and Tablet were free, now tells us that only the Tablet was free and the Ipad was half off. Also, the promotion for the IPhone was for half off. So, we paid for half of the phone, therefore the phone should've been all paid for. But, the associate tells us that no, only some of that went towards the phone and the rest went towards the IPhone and Tablet.......which were supposed to be free. I was told it would cost $30 for the 2 data lines for those devices, yet they billed me $53. Nothing I was told that day was correct or legit. The associate either truly wasn't trained in on his position correctly, or he just didn't care and scammed us into purchasing and paying for more than we needed. Then when I said that I just wanted to return the items and go back to my old plan, I was told I would have to pay $120 in restocking fees for the Ipad and Tablet. The store associate told me that he contacted his manager about issuing me a $100 bill credit and that he would call me the following day to confirm. That phone call was never received. The Specialist we spoke to over the phone while at the store said he was going to escalate these issues up and call me on that Monday to see if they could do anything to resolve the issues. That call was never received either. So, it turns out that basically every T-Mobile employee I spoke with that day lied straight to my face and fed me a big spoonful of bullsh*t. I feel swindled, scammed, cheated, and lied to and that is completely unacceptable. This may be my sign to leave T-Mobile and make the switch to another carrier."

I have been a costumer for years. I left another company because it was shady and I feel t-mobile is playing the same games. I subscribed for a free version of Netflix and they switched it on their own to the paid one. I then unsubscribed and they were still charging me till I call.To bad they are playing these games.Always check you bill.

"My experience with TMobile has been nothing but wasted money, time and stress. Since switching from Verizon to them I’ve filed 3 claims for phones that have been consistently inoperable. The most recent event was yesterday where I spent 4 hours on the phone including two hours today, where I’ve been getting the run around. They tried to tell me I was’t paying my insurance premium when it’s automatically taken out of my bill totaling $700/month, so they not only told me I was uncovered but then retracted and said I was. I still don’t have the phone that’s needed to run my business and they tried to offer me $50 to compensate for the inconvenience and time. Their associates are not trained properly and have poor documentation as I’ve repeatedly explained the issue to over 5 representatives. The end result is: no phone! I highly recommend not switching or using T-Mobile. I have not been compensated for my time or money I’ve lost and felt humiliated when they assumed I didn’t pay my insurance payment."
